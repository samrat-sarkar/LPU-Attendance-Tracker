# LPU Attendance Tracker 
The LPU Attendance Tracker program is a simple Python-based program designed to help LPU students check their attendance quickly and easily. This program sends a request to the LPU server, logs in with the provided credentials, and fetches the attendance data. The program then displays the attendance data in a user-friendly format using the Tkinter library in Python.

This program ensures your privacy and security by encrypting your login credentials and using different user-agents with each request to avoid getting blocked by the server's security mechanisms.

With this program, you can stay up-to-date with your attendance and avoid any surprises at the end of the semester. Whether you're a student at LPU or just someone curious about how this program works, we hope you find it useful and informative.
